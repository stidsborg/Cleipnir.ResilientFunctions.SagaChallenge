# Cleipnir's ResilientFunctions Saga Challenge

Hey there and welcome to the saga training camp!

We have prepared 3 challenges for you.
1. [First challenge](./tree/main/Challenge%231) is about handling at-most-once and at-least-once (plus idempotency) concerns.
2. [Second challenge](./tree/main/Challenge%232) is concerned with versioning a resilient function while avoiding down time.
3. Third challenges involves a more complicated versioning example.
