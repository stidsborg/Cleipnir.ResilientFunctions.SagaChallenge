# Cleipnir's ResilientFunctions Saga Challenge

Hey there and welcome to the saga training camp!

We have prepared 3 challenges for you.
1. [First challenge](https://github.com/stidsborg/Cleipnir.ResilientFunctions.SagaChallenge/tree/main/Challenge%231) is about handling at-most-once and at-least-once (plus idempotency) concerns.
2. [Second challenge](https://github.com/stidsborg/Cleipnir.ResilientFunctions.SagaChallenge/tree/main/Challenge%232) is concerned with versioning a resilient function while avoiding down time.
